# Headless CMS App

In this assignment, on my **Pantheon** hosted **Wordpress** account, I created a **Wordpress** child theme.
I then used **SFTP** to update a **PHP** functions file
which enabled a unique **REST** endpoint url.
The data from that endpoint is then displayed on a basic **Next.js** app, written in **Javascript** and using **React** components,
which was then deployed to **Vercel**.
